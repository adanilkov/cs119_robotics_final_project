## Codebase Details

Altough a ROS package, this repository is meant to be used as a workspace, `object-picker` supports the Interbotix px100 robot arm and includes:

1. **Training RL policies** (PPO or SAC) for picking up a "T"-shaped object.
2. **Initializing policies with IL** (Behavioral Cloning).
3. **Running trained policies** on the real robot.
4. **Pre-trained models** from our experiments.

### Code Structure

The `src` of our package (`object-picker`) is structured as follows:

```python
üìÅ src
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ config.py # global constants and parameters
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ env.py    # training-env code (reward logic & training primitives)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ gazebo.py # code handling topic and service comms with gazebo sim
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ run.py    # loads and runs policies on real px100
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ train.py  # main entrypoint for training
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÑ utils.py  # generic helper functions
```

### How to Run the Code

‚ÑπÔ∏è **Run training:** To run the training script with the parameters specified in the `if __name__ == '__main__':` block, you must:

1. Launch ROS with:
    ```bash
    roslaunch
    ```
2. Start the Gazebo simulation with:
    ```bash
    roslaunch interbotix_xsarm_gazebo xsarm_gazebo.launch robot_model:=px100 use_position_controllers:=true gui:=false use_rviz:=true
    ```
    Or (depending on whether you want the Gazebo GUI or RViz to open)
    ```bash
    roslaunch interbotix_xsarm_gazebo xsarm_gazebo.launch robot_model:=px100 use_position_controllers:=true gui:=true
    ```
3. Start the training script with:
    ```bash
    rosrun object-picker train.py
    ```
    Or, `cd` into the `src` directory and run:
    ```bash
    python train.py
    ```


‚ÑπÔ∏è **Run real px100:** To run the trained models on the real px100 robot arm:

1. Run:
    ```bash
    rosrun object-picker run.py
    ```
    Or, `cd` into the `src` directory and run:
    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```

### Reward Function

The reward function is stateful and is as follows:

1. **_'Assuming lifting position'_ term** term:
    - **_'Get low'_ term:** Z-value of gripper
    - **_'Get close'_ term:** Only once the gripper is low (and not before), the negative of the distance between the gripper and the object (since the forklift must get low before it can insert).
        - Once the gripper is both low and close (and not before), the _'get low'_ term is removed and replaced with a constant `1.0` (to prevent the _'get low'_ term from discouraging the lifting up of the object).
2. **_'Lifting the object'_ term:** The negative of the distance between the object and the goal position (raised in the air).
